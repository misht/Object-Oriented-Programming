Easy and difficult issues with the assigment:

I have some experience programming in Java but for example, here my worst challenge has been to know a good structure 
of the program because for me it is so open that you can program the same thing in many ways. As soon as the skills, 
I think that for now, I am fine since the logic of this program was not difficult.

What did you learn from the assigment?

In Assignment 1, I have learned that clean the buffer is important since you can have problems after reading a double and 
you can do it in a simple way with read.nextLine(). Besides, I have also learned that passing the parameters of the getters 
and the constructors with the final word make more secure your program. In addition, I have learned that in order to have a 
while that contemplates a lot of conditions, you can use while(true) and then when the condition that you want is fulfilled 
you can go out of the program with a break (I have used this, in order to make a menu). Apart from this, I have understood 
that while you do not use nested whiles and ifs, it is not bad programming to use a break. Finally, I think that I have learned 
how to do a cleaner program since I have always made every test inside the main function and here, I have made separate functions 
in the main class and then, I have tested them in the main function apart from doing all the communications with the user in the main class.
