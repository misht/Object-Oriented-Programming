Easy and difficult issues with the assignment:

The most difficult part of this assignment has been the understanding of what 
I was supposed to do so I have implemented inheritance and a container to store 
plots based on what I have read in the evaluation criteria. The implementation was 
not difficult since I have worked with all in the previous assignments.

What did you learn from the assignment?
In this assignment, I have reviewed most of the things that I have worked on such 
as inheritance, containers, etc. In addition, I have learned to make better structures and 
connections between classes.
