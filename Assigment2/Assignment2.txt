Easy and difficult issues with the assigment:

From my point of view, the most difficult part of this assignment has been to create relations between the classes, 
since at the beginning I did not understand very well how to do it but after the teacher explained it to me it was easier. 
As for the easiest, I think it has been the implementation of the classes since they are quite simple.

What did your learn about the assigment?
Thanks to this assignment I have learned that printing inside the constructors in real life is only done to test them and 
that having several constructors with different parameters is not considered incorrect. On the other hand, I have learned to 
create relationships between different classes and that all interaction with the user must be done in the main.
