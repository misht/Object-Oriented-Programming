Easy and difficult issues with the assigment:

From my point of view, the main task of the assignment was not difficult. However, the complicated thing is to think about
the structure of the program and how the classes communicate with each other, especially now that the inheritance comes 
into play. The most difficult thing in this assignment has been to understand the inheritance and know how to use it since 
the idea is that the father contains the most general and the son is the specification.

What did you learn from the assigment?

In this assignment, I have learned to use inheritance. I have learned that in the constructors you have to call the constructor 
parent with the word super()in the child constructor, also that with that same word you can call methods of the parent class in 
the child class. Besides,  if we create an instance of the father such as Father f = new Father(), we can not access the child's 
methods, on the contrary, if we create an instance like Father f = new Child (), we will access the son's methods. Finally, we 
can also override the methods in the children in such a way that we make them more specific.
